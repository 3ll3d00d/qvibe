## What is qvibe?

qvibe is a suite of applications that enable you to assess the tactile response (TR) of your home cinema setup by feeding data from 1 or more sensors measuring vibration at your seating position.

qvibe is composed of 2 separate applications:

* qvibe-recorder: a small application that is designed to run on a raspberry pi connected to a MPU-6050 accelerometer
* qvibe-analyser: an application that can run on a Windows, Mac or Linux machine
